    // a shim for distinguishing between image files which could not be found and those which could not be loaded
    // This class borders on unnecessary.  In general, a loadable image produces a MemoryImage (possibly with DecodeError = true,
    // implying corruption) and an image which cannot be loaded can be indicated by a null pointer.  However, a narrow range of cases
    // occurs where an image file exists on disk but is so corrupted or truncated no decoding is possible.  MemoryImage { DecodeError
    // = true } also applies to these cases and the special casing needed to produce an empty MemoryImage with the flag set is arguably
    // less complex than interposing the CachedImage class.  However, a C# surface for this purpose is somewhat lower cost to maintain
    // than a C++/CLI one.
