### Overview
This repository contains the source for [Timelapse 2](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage), created by Saul Greenberg of the University of Calgary and Greenberg Consulting.  Contact the dev team if you have questions about using Timelapse for carnivore monitoring.  For other types of studies please contact Saul directly via the link above.

### Dev Environment
Install [Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) or similar with the below options in addition to the defaults:

* Common Tools -> GitHub Extension for Visual Studio

After installation clone the repo locally through Visual Studio's Team Explorer.

Development must be done against .NET 4.0 as as not all Timelapse users have newer versions available on their systems or the ability to update .NET.

### Dependencies
* Timelapse and the template editor require .NET 4.0 or newer.
* Timelapse and the template editor are tested on Windows 10 and should run without issue on Windows 8.1, 8, 7, and Vista.  Some degradation may occur XP but most features and flows should work.
* Screen size of 1600 x 900 or larger is recommended.
