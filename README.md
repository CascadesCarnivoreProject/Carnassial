### Overview
This repository contains the source for Carnassial.  Contact the dev team if you have questions about using Carnassial for carnivore monitoring.

### Dev Environment
Install [Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) Update 3 or newer with the below options in addition to the defaults:

* Common Tools -> GitHub Extension for Visual Studio

After installation clone the repo locally through Visual Studio's Team Explorer or GitHub's clone or download option.

Development must be done against .NET 4.0 as as not all users have newer versions available on their systems or the ability to update .NET.  A move to .NET 4.5 is expected but a date hasn't been set.

### Dependencies
* Carnassial and the template editor require .NET 4.0 or newer.
* Carnassial and the template editor are tested on Windows 10 and should run without issue on Windows 8.1, 8, 7 SP1, and Vista SP2.
* Windows XP SP3 is not supported but .NET 4.0 is available and most Carnassial features and flows probably work.
* Screen size of 1600 x 900 or larger is recommended.

### History
Carnassial began as a substantial overhaul of Timelapse 2.0 for improved code quality and sufficient flexibility to accomodate typical carnivore studies.  [Timelapse 2.1](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage) includes much of the Carnassial effort through September 2016 and the two projects remain parallel due to the similar needs they serve.
